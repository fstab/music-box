This is an intermediate step towards implementing a simple DJ software library.

At its current state, this is just a test program. It might not be too usefull.

If you are interested in its future development, please follow my blog at

The current version provides a simple scriptable audio player.
It supports the following command line options:

./music-box [-l logfile] [-q]
   -l <logfile>: Log to file instead of stderr
   -q: Quiet mode. Do not show the prompt. Usefull for scripting.

When you run music-box, you will be prompted for commands. The following
commands are supported:

  load <file.mp3> as <var>
    Load an mp3 file and store it in variable <var>
    For filenames with spaces, type the filename in "double quotes".
  play <var>
    Start playing the file loaded as <var>
  pause <var>
    Pause the file loaded as <var>
  resume <var>
    If <var> is paused, resume playing <var>
  wait for <var>
    wait until file <var> is done playing
  unload <var>
    Unload the mp3 file and free the variable <var>
  sleep <seconds>
    sleep for <seconds> seconds
  quit
    quit the application

You can also write the commands into a script file and pipe it to music-box.
The following is an example script which starts playing test1.mp3, waits
3 seconds, and starts mixing in test2.mp3.

load test1.mp3 as x
load test2.mp3 as y
play x
sleep 3
play y
wait x
wait y
quit
