This is the initial commit for my music box project. So far, this is just a
collection of files that I copied from other projects:

The following files are taken from madlld-1.1p1, which is a "how to" program
about libmad's low-level API for decoding mp3s.

  * src/bstdfile.c
  * src/bstdfile.h
  * src/madlld.c

The following file is taken from PulseAudio and shows how to play back audio
streams on a PulseAudio sound server. See http://pulseaudio.org.

  * src/pacat.c
