music box 1 / what is it about?
===============================

I'm building a music box, which is supposed to be some kind of hardware mp3
player with some basic DJing functionality. This first post is just some
collection of thoughts about what it's going to be.

functionality
-------------

  * pre-listen to songs on the headphones while the current song keeps playing
    on the speakers
  * some kind of basic mixing, like a cross fader
  * running my own software, so I can extend it.

style
-----

OK, there are many devices that do this. Why do I build my own, except for the
fun of it?

  * Most DJ devices look like high end high tech blinking plastic black and
    silver controllers. I don't want that. I want a device that looks
    [gem&uuml;tlich][1], like crappy unpretentious DIY stuff. Maybe kind of an
    old shoe box with some buttons on it (non-blinking).
  * Many DJ devices are just controllers, and you need a laptop to play the
    music. I don't want to carry my laptop around. I want to take that box with
    me, and it should have my mp3 collection and everything in it.

And, as soon as the box works, I hope I can implement some fancy sound
processing algorithms and play around with something I came up with.
